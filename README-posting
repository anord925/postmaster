  When you're ready to post, be sure to do things in the following order:

         % ./AddPost.pl [post-file] [research/fun]
         % ./UpdateCatalogs.pl
         % ./UpdateNavBars.pl

  AddPost modifies the relevant 'posts-by-date.txt' file, which informs
  the catalog structure, and because 'UpdateCatalogs' ends up clearing
  navbar content you'll want to run 'UpdateNavBars' last.

  I *should* just write a shell script, but whatever.  We'll want to
  make sure what's here is operational before I get carried away with
  fine-tuning and adding bells and/or whistles.

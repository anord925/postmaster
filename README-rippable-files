File Elements:

+ Any PLAIN TEXT will be written as paragraph text.
  Empty lines will demarcate paragraph breaks.

+ A TITLE is NECESSARY, and is whatever's on the first line.

+ A CATEGORY is ALSO NECESSARY, and is whatever's on the
  second line (currently this has to be either 'research'
  or 'play').

+ IMAGES can be added with the following html-like code:

      <img ~/yadda/yadda/blah>

  A local copy will be produced for the actual site.
  I'd recommend absolute pathing just because this
  isn't going to be pro-grade software (sorry).

  Resizing is automatic, so don't sweat your disgusting
  little head about it.

  Images can't be embedded inside paragraphs because
  that would be the worst thing your eyes ever did
  experience.

+ Link text the way you want it in the html, you big
  crybaby.  Something like this, perhaps?

      <a href="http://www.piss.jizz">CUM TIME</a>

+ Text can become italicized by surrounding it with
  asterisks.  If a period is seen before the downstream
  asterisk, fugged aboud it (so you can still have
  character '*').

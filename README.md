Hello!

This is the code that I use to maintain my personal website.
It's probably not interesting as something to contribute to,
but feel free to borrow / draw inspiration if you're setting
up your own SquareSpace-free bloggy-type site and want to
see how I (someone who sucks at web stuff) barreled through
making a website.

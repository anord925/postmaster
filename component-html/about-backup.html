	"Ahoy!" -Alex Nord, 2021
      </p>
      <p>
	Thank you for joining me in taking an interest in me!
	As you may have guessed, this is a website all about
	the living legend many have referred to as "Alex Nord,"
	but you may find yourself wondering, "Who is this enigmantic
	man, and how did he find himself with the unfathomable
	amount of free time that it takes to create a vanity website?"
	Well, theorize no more, because I am on the very precipice
	of unveiling the true identity of our dear Alex!
      </p>
      <p>
	I'll kick things off by mentioning that I'm a he/him pronouns
	user living in the beautiful little city of Missoula, MT.
	With that out of the way, and in full compliance with the dictates
	of late-stage capitalism, I shall signal that my primary identity is
	my occupation by describing that aspect of my life first!
      </p>
      <p>
	I'm a researcher in the <a href="http://wheelerlab.org/">Wheeler Lab Group</a>,
	which is a scrappy collection of terrifically brilliant, computationally-minded
	folks working on problems in the field of biological sequence analysis.
	My contributions to the group revolve around developing tools to improve sequence analysis
	by accounting for the role that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA_splicing">RNA splicing</a>
	plays in producing the amino acid sequences that we all know and love.
	Do I have the best job in the world, or what?
      </p>
      <p>
	When I'm not writing code, I love putting my energy towards a
	handful of creative outlets (I take a quantity over quality
	approach with my interests!).
	I share my apartment with four guitars, so there's ample shreddage
	and jammification to be found around these parts.
	I also dabble in electronic music production, but primarily wind up
	making weird bass-heavy sounds rather than putting together songs.
	Outside of music I enjoy doodling, and I have to admit that I've 
	started feeling that unmistakable urge to try my hand at video game
	design.
	Speaking of video games, you'd better believe that (as a nerdy
	gentleman of a certain age) I play more than my fair share!
      </p>
      <p>
	Are you still reading this?
	Geez, you just can't get enough (not that I can blame you for
	your exceptional tastes in narcissistic science idiots)!
	If you're dying for more high-quality Alex Nord content,
	don't hesitate to reach out!
